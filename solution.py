solution.py — the ONLY file a team has to implement.

The organizers' harness (run_submission.py) imports this module and calls:

    detect_events(video_path)  -> [[start_sec, end_sec, label], ...]    # Part A
    RiskEstimator().reset(meta); .step(frame, t_sec) -> float           # Part B (optional)

Keep the names and signatures exactly as they are. Everything else — models,
tracking, rules, helper modules under src/ — is up to you.

Labels must come from CLASSES. You may REMOVE classes you never predict;
do not add new ids.

    Args:
        video_path: path to one .mp4 file. You may open it any way you like
            (OpenCV, decord, PyAV, ffmpeg), read it several times, sample
            frames, run batched models — anything goes.

        A list of events, each ``[start_sec, end_sec, label]`` with
        ``0 <= start_sec < end_sec <= duration`` (floats, seconds from the
        first frame) and ``label in CLASSES``. Return ``[]`` if nothing
        happened. Segments of the same class must not overlap.

    A typical pipeline:
        1. sample frames (every 2nd–5th frame is usually enough),
        2. detect road users (YOLO / RT-DETR) and track them (ByteTrack),
        3. turn trajectories + scene layout (lanes, stop line, crossing)
           into per-frame flags for each class,
        4. merge consecutive flags into segments, drop blips < 0.5 s,
           merge gaps < 1 s,
        5. optionally re-score `accident` / `near_miss` candidates with a
           learned clip classifier.
